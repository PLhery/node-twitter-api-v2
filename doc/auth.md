# Authentication

This part will guide you through the multiple steps of Twitter API authentication process
inside `twitter-api-v2` package.

Please first see the [Basics](./basics.md) to know how to create a client with your application keys.

***First***, you must know which type of authentication you want to use.

- User authentication (3-legged OAuth 1.0a flow, see [User-wide authentication flow](#user-wide-authentication-flow))
- App-only authentication (Bearer token, see [Application-only authentication flow](#application-only-authentication-flow))
- Basic authentication (couple of username+password, see [Basic authentication flow](#basic-authentication-flow))
- User authentication, but with fine-grained scopes (3-legged OAuth 2 flow, see [User-wide authentication flow for OAuth2](#oauth2-user-wide-authentication-flow))

**Note**: You can find a [project real-life example of a 3-legged auth flow here](https://github.com/alkihis/twitter-api-v2-user-oauth-flow-example).

## User-wide authentication flow

Many endpoints on the Twitter developer platform use the OAuth 1.0a method to act on behalf of a Twitter account.
For example, if you have a Twitter developer app, you can make API requests on behalf of any Twitter account as long as that user authenticates your app.

This method is **fairly the most complex** of authentication flow options, but it is, at least for now, the **most used method across Twitter API**.

It is named "3-legged" because it is split in 3 parts:
1. You (the app/server) generate a auth link that is clickable by a external user, and gives you *temporary* access tokens
2. The user clicks on the link, approves the application, it gives you a verifier token
3. You use the *temporary* access tokens and verifier token to obtain **user-specific** *persistent* access tokens

**NOTE**
> - If you're building a server that serves content for users,
>   you need to "remember" (store) some data between the first two steps,
>   so be sure you have a available session-like store (file/memory/Redis/...) to share data across same-user requests.
> - Between steps 1 & 2, users are redirected to official Twitter website. That means you need to have ***either***:
>   - A dedicated page in your website meant to "welcome back" users that have been sent to Twitter (this is called **oauth callback**)
>   - A dedicated input field where users can input a *PIN code* when they accepted you app on Twitter

### Create the auth link

You need to have a client instantiated with your **consumer keys** from Twitter.
```ts
const client = new TwitterApi({ appKey: CONSUMER_KEY, appSecret: CONSUMER_SECRET });
```

To create the authentication link, use `client.generateAuthLink()` method.
**If you choose to redirect users to your website after authentication, you need to provide a callback URL here.**
```ts
const authLink = await client.generateAuthLink(CALLBACK_URL);

// By default, oauth/authenticate are used for auth links, you can change with linkMode
// property in second parameter to 'authorize' to use oauth/authorize
const authLink = await client.generateAuthLink(CALLBACK_URL, { linkMode: 'authorize' });

// Use URL generated
const ... = authLink.url;
```

**IMPORTANT**: You need to store `authLink.oauth_token` and `authLink.oauth_token_secret` somewhere,
because you will need them for step 2.

### Collect temporary access tokens and get persistent tokens

#### Case 1: User has been redirected to your callback URL
When Twitter redirects to your page, it provides two query string parameters: `oauth_token` and `oauth_verifier`.

**NOTE**: If the user refuses app access, `oauth_verifier` will not be provided.

You need to extract those tokens, find the linked `oauth_token_secret` from given `oauth_token` (using your session store!),
then ask for persistent tokens.

Create a client with these tokens as access token, then call `client.login(oauth_verifier)` to create a logged client.

An example flow will be written here using the **express** framework, feel free to adapt to your case.

```ts
app.get('/callback', (req, res) => {
  // Extract tokens from query string
  const { oauth_token, oauth_verifier } = req.query;
  // Get the saved oauth_token_secret from session
  const { oauth_token_secret } = req.session;

  if (!oauth_token || !oauth_verifier || !oauth_token_secret) {
    return res.status(400).send('You denied the app or your session expired!');
  }

  // Obtain the persistent tokens
  // Create a client from temporary tokens
  const client = new TwitterApi({
    appKey: CONSUMER_KEY,
    appSecret: CONSUMER_SECRET,
    accessToken: oauth_token,
    accessSecret: oauth_token_secret,
  });

  client.login(oauth_verifier)
    .then(({ client: loggedClient, accessToken, accessSecret }) => {
      // loggedClient is an authenticated client in behalf of some user
      // Store accessToken & accessSecret somewhere
    })
    .catch(() => res.status(403).send('Invalid verifier or access tokens!'));
});
```

#### Case 2: You choose to use a PIN

You need to extract the given PIN and use it as `oauth_verifier`.

Create a client with previously obtain tokens (during link generation step) as access token,
then call `client.login(given_pin)` to create a logged client.

```ts
// Obtain the persistent tokens
// Create a client from temporary tokens
const client = new TwitterApi({
  appKey: CONSUMER_KEY,
  appSecret: CONSUMER_SECRET,
  accessToken: oauth_token, // oauth token from previous step (link generation)
  accessSecret: oauth_token_secret, // oauth token secret from previous step (link generation)
});

// Give the PIN to client.login()
const { client: loggedClient, accessToken, accessSecret } = await client.login(GIVEN_USER_PIN);
// loggedClient is an authenticated client in behalf of some user
// Store accessToken & accessSecret somewhere
```

### Finally, get the full logged user object

You can use the method `.currentUser()` on your client.

This a shortcut to `.v1.verifyCredentials()` with a **cache that store user to avoid multiple API calls**.
Its returns a `UserV1` object.

## Application-only authentication flow

App-only flow use a single OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token that authenticates requests on behalf of your developer App.
As this method is specific to the App, it does not involve any users.
This method is typically for developers that need read-only access to public information.

You can instantiate a Twitter API client with two ways:
- If you already know your Bearer token (you can obtain it in the developer portal), you can use it directly in the constructor as a `string`:
```ts
const client = new TwitterApi(MY_BEARER_TOKEN);
```
- Otherwise, if you've stored your consumers (key & secret, the same needed for OAuth 1.0a flow), you can use them to obtain a fresh Bearer token:
```ts
const consumerClient = new TwitterApi({ appKey: CONSUMER_KEY, appSecret: CONSUMER_SECRET });
// Obtain app-only client
const client = await consumerClient.appLogin();
```

## Basic authentication flow

Mainly for **Twitter enterprise APIs**, that require the use of HTTP Basic Authentication.
You must pass a valid email address and password combination for each request.
The email and password combination are the same ones that you will use to access the enterprise API console, and can be edited from within this console.

Use this combination to create your Twitter API client:
```ts
const client = new TwitterApi({ username: MY_USERNAME, password: MY_PASSWORD });
```

## OAuth2 user-wide authentication flow

Alternatively of OAuth 1.0a method, you can use OAuth2 user-context, which is restricted to **v2 of Twitter API**.
This process is very similar of one used in OAuth 1.0a, so it's recommended to read it first to understand what's happening below.

The main advantage of this method is that you can **explicitly specify which part of data you'll need from the Twitter user's account**.
These parts are called **scopes**.

This authentication is split into 3 parts:
1. You (the app/server) generate a auth link with your client ID that is clickable by an external user
2. The user clicks on the link, approves the application, it gives you a client code
3. You use a code verifier generated at the first step along the client code to obtain **user-specific** access token; this token has a dedicated lifetime that can be extended with refresh tokens

**NOTE**

>   you need to "remember" (store) some data between the first two steps,
>   so be sure you have a available session-like store (file/memory/Redis/...) to share data across same-user requests.
> - Between steps 1 & 2, users are redirected to official Twitter website. That means you need to have a dedicated page in your website meant to "welcome back" users that have been sent to Twitter (this is called **oauth callback**)

### Create the auth link

You need to have a client instantiated with your **client keys** from Twitter.
If you've declared app as "public" app, you only need your **client ID**, if you've declared app as "confidential" app, you will need **client ID and client secret**.

```ts
const client = new TwitterApi({ clientId: CLIENT_ID, clientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET });
```

To create the authentication link, use `client.generateOAuth2AuthLink()` method.
**You need to provide a callback URL here.**
```ts
// Don't forget to specify 'offline.access' in scope list if you want to refresh your token later
const { url, codeVerifier, state } = client.generateOAuth2AuthLink(CALLBACK_URL, { scope: ['tweet.read', 'users.read', 'offline.access', ...] });

// Redirect your user to {url}, store {state} and {codeVerifier} into a DB/Redis/memory after user redirection
```

**IMPORTANT**: You need to store `state` and `codeVerifier` somewhere,
because you will need them for step 2.

### Collect returned auth codes and get access token

When Twitter redirects to your page, it provides two query string parameters: `code` and `state`.

**NOTE**: If the user refuses app access, `code` will not be provided.

You need to extract those tokens, find the linked `codeVerifier` from given `state` (using your session store!), then ask for access token.

Create a client with your **client ID** (and the **client secret** if it's needed), like at step 1.

An example flow will be written here using the **express** framework, feel free to adapt to your case.

```ts
app.get('/callback', (req, res) => {
  // Extract state and code from query string
  const { state, code } = req.query;
  // Get the saved codeVerifier from session
  const { codeVerifier, state: sessionState } = req.session;

  if (!codeVerifier || !state || !sessionState || !code) {
    return res.status(400).send('You denied the app or your session expired!');
  }
  if (state !== sessionState) {
    return res.status(400).send('Stored tokens didnt match!');
  }

  // Obtain access token
  const client = new TwitterApi({ clientId: CLIENT_ID, clientSecret: CLIENT_SECRET });

  client.loginWithOAuth2({ code, codeVerifier, redirectUri: CALLBACK_URL })
    .then(async ({ client: loggedClient, accessToken, refreshToken, expiresIn }) => {
      // {loggedClient} is an authenticated client in behalf of some user
      // Store {accessToken} somewhere, it will be valid until {expiresIn} is hit.
      // If you want to refresh your token later, store {refreshToken} (it is present if 'offline.access' has been given as scope)

      // Example request
      const { data: userObject } = await loggedClient.v2.me();
    })
    .catch(() => res.status(403).send('Invalid verifier or access tokens!'));
});
```

### Use your access token

The `.loginWithOAuth2()` method already returns a logged client, but if you want to create an instance by yourself with an access token (for example to make a request from a saved access token), use it as a **Bearer token**.

```ts
const client = new TwitterApi('<YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN>');
```

### Optional: refresh the token later

If you choose to include `'offline.access'` as scope, you can store and re-use later `refreshToken` when `expiresIn` time kicks in.

```ts
const client = new TwitterApi({ clientId: '<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>', clientSecret: '<YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET>' });

// Obtain the {refreshToken} from your DB/store
const { client: refreshedClient, accessToken, refreshToken: newRefreshToken } = await client.refreshOAuth2Token(refreshToken);

// Store refreshed {accessToken} and {newRefreshToken} to replace the old ones

// Example request
await refreshedClient.v2.me();
```
